# Object-Oriented-Programming
Projects based on object oriented programming principles

1. Operations on Sets
 The program performs operations such as intersection, reunion and cartesian product on finite sets of integers represented as linked lists.

2. Trees
 The program keeps a rooted tree and a binary search tree and prints them using different traversing algorithms, such as DFS and BFS. The trees are saved as linked lists, with links between each father and it's leftmost son and between each son and it's first brother to the right.

3. Dry-Cleaner's Simulator (School Project)
 The program keeps data about each customer's laundry and prints each garment separately with the amount of detergent used and the time spent in all of the machines.
